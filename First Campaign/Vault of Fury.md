1. Vault of Fury
  * There is a Vault within Fey-Wild
    * It is called the Vault of Fury
    * It is roughly 5 days from Gervirgal
      * Party can go through Boycheq for safety but will add 3 days travel to the journey
  * The vault was owned by a adventuring party who died in the change, they were semi-local heroes, The Stone Setters (Druid, Ranger, Cleric, Wizard)
    * *The party was very nature orientated*
  * Their is a point that is reported to be the location but it can't be confirmed.
    * it should be in the back of a large house just outside a town
  * The Contracter gets 30% and Acq Inc gets 20% of any finds
1. Once reaching the alleged point, there is no way for the party to find the Vault immediately
  * The town is gone and the house has seemed to be moved
    * it hasn't been moved, the maps were just wrong
1. They must spend at least 1 day attempting to find the House and vault
1. Explain searching rules
  * Each day everyone can make a check, they can't make the same check from the day before and can't make the same check as another person
    * they can choose to help
  * They need 3 boons over all the days to find it
    * 1-6, a bane
    * 7-13, nothing
    * 14+, a boon
  * The more banes per day, the worse the day goes (max: 3)
    * 1 bane, you lose one boon
    * 2 banes, you have to fight a group of creatures
    * 3 banes, you lose a boon and have to fight
1. They find the House, it is empty and seems protected from the wilds
1. They find the vault but in order to open it they need to solve a puzzle based on an important item to the party
  * the puzzle involves using the item in 3 ways to open the door
    * they need to use the emblem/symbol of the party which is found in the house
  * The door has complex moving parts but 3 parts stick out
    1. 2 holes that seem to be connected but are too small for most things to fit through, by letting the rat roll through the top hole it will allow the next piece to move
    * there is a hook that is then revealed inside a large piece of stone, using the knotted tail you can hook it onto the hook and pull back the stone
    * this reveals a odd key shape that can be turned with the head of the rat
      * Red Herrings:
        * a hollow piece that has a small hole in it
        * handle that can turn 90 degrees
        * a torch slot on the door that feels loose
        * a bunch of gears that turn when the correct things are done but can turn 1 revolution without doing them if forced.
        * 4 handprints in the vault door
1. The emblem is a piece of wood that is in the shape of a rat, the rat has a knotted tail and a open mouth with sharp teeth, as well as a small roller on the base, described like a toy
  * The emblem can be found in the Bathroom and the Greenhouse
1. The house is relatively small and many of the items are in disrepair but there is 3 rooms that seem useful
  * The Kitchen, Red Herrings:
    * ornate cutlery (5sp for all of them)
    * various god symbols
    * a painting of the people with a note behind it
      * In Draconic: I moved the spare to the greenhouse
    * A Bunch of Keys
  * The Greenhouse
    * Loads of a plants
    * a tree that grows in complex shapes
    * A rat
      * *Has a slight golden shimmer, noticed with +20 perception*
    * A piece of glass that reflects light interestingly
    * a bunch of "herbs" and "spices"
      * Con saving roll or temporary reduction of hitpoints/stat rolls
  * the Bathroom
    * Bath Stuff that looks natural and odd
    * Some tools, some of which looks interesting
    * There is a leopard in the bathtub, doesn't attack unless provoked
    * There is a small mirror with plants growing around it
    * There is a piece of soap cut to look like a rat
  * The other rooms are:
    * 3 bedrooms
    * a storeroom
    * a dining room
      * many of the items in these room are missing and the room seems semi-torn apart.
1. When the rat is found and the party solves the puzzle, the vault door opens and reveals a medium sized cavern with lots of a light and fauna
  * The floor is also covered in rats but it there are so many it seems like the floor is moving
    * there is nearly 2000 rats
  * In the center is a pedestal with a flute on it
1. when they open the door, loads of rats come out and they can notice that they have a golden shimmer. **Roll Initiative**
1. If they try to hurt any rats, 3 swarms will arise and attack them.
1. if they try to wade through they have to make a check or be covered in rats and miss a turn
  * if they miss a turn they must make a strength saving throw to start moving again
  * it takes 2 turns to get to the centre and every turn 200 rats leave the Vault
    * Any spellcaster can try to make a check to use the pipe (Wis Check)
      * Anything above 10 causes the rats in the cavern to stay still
      * Anything above 15 causes the rats in the cavern to come towards the centre (orderly)
      * Anything above 20 causes them to be under the control of the caster and they know that they can cause any under control of the caster to become coins instantly
    * If the caster doesn't know they can make all of them become coins, they can squeeze one to become a single coin
      * It would take 0.2mins*num of rats for the party to squeeze all of them, and 20% of the rats leave in that time.
1. On the way back they can chart out the true location of the house and will receive 5 GP for the correction
1. They get back home and through the hordesperson point they can deliver the correct proportion of gold
