        <td>Slate Fever – An uncommon sickness that causes skin to become hard and brittle. Originating from the underdark and eventually making its way to the surface, Slate Fever propagates through contact with mosses and fungi contaminated with the disease, as well as through contact with the affected skin of those with the sickness. Early symptoms include a slight grey discoloration of skin tone, uncomfortable stiffness, and unusual amounts of neck and back cracking when moving. The symptoms eventually progress to the point where the diseased becomes noticeably grey and stiff, causing them to move in small, jerk-like motions and have their speed reduced by half. In addition, the diseased develops exceptionally brittle skin that cracks easily and painfully. This gives them vulnerability to bludgeoning damage and causes them to frequently make Constitution saving throws to avoid taking 1d4 damage from shattering parts of their skin with excessive contact. The disease itself usually passes by itself over the course of one week resting and recuperating, but can be cured within 2 days if the diseased is properly treated with a combination of various tree saps. Catching this disease once results in the diseased being more vulnerable to it in the future.</td>

But killing a dryad who is ill or favored by the gods will surely inflict this disease should any of her sap touch your skin. First, blindness and deafness slowly takes you, soon followed by sluggishness and fatigue. Then, your body begins to painfully turn, inside out, into the hard, coarse bark of an old dying tree. Your body rejects food, so you begin to starve. You require ten times the amount of water you normally do, or you will die of thirst. Your limbs become too heavy to move and your skin takes the flaky, layered appearance of wood chips. Your throat will eventually become thick and you will die of asphyxiation, and finally your body will be grown over with bark, and you will become a misshapen pile of vile sap and wood.</td>

The cure is to drink very hard alcohol, and let it dissolve the stomach acid poison. Another option is to survive 10 hours. A lesser restoration spell automatically cures it.
