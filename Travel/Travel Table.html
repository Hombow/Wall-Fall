        <td>Slate Fever – An uncommon sickness that causes skin to become hard and brittle. Originating from the underdark and eventually making its way to the surface, Slate Fever propagates through contact with mosses and fungi contaminated with the disease, as well as through contact with the affected skin of those with the sickness. Early symptoms include a slight grey discoloration of skin tone, uncomfortable stiffness, and unusual amounts of neck and back cracking when moving. The symptoms eventually progress to the point where the diseased becomes noticeably grey and stiff, causing them to move in small, jerk-like motions and have their speed reduced by half. In addition, the diseased develops exceptionally brittle skin that cracks easily and painfully. This gives them vulnerability to bludgeoning damage and causes them to frequently make Constitution saving throws to avoid taking 1d4 damage from shattering parts of their skin with excessive contact. The disease itself usually passes by itself over the course of one week resting and recuperating, but can be cured within 2 days if the diseased is properly treated with a combination of various tree saps. Catching this disease once results in the diseased being more vulnerable to it in the future.</td>
